Hi, my name is Svetlana. I am from Shchelkovo city of Moscow region.

I graduated from the Institute of Tourism Technology with a degree in financial management in tourism. That's why I went to work for a big tour operator company.

At first, I worked in the sales department and I was selling tourist vouchers. Then I moved to the advertising department, where I was preparing catalog layout for printing. There were times when companies printed huge catalogs with all their products at exhibitions. Also in the advertising department, I took over the support and content of the site. That's when my love for the web-design has began.

Back in two thousand and fifth year, I even took courses on HTML and CSS at the Bauman Institute, but these were completely different languages than they are now.

Next, I joined a company that created several online beauty magazines. There I supervised the stages of website creation, provided communication with developers. After the websites were ready, I was engaged in its daily activities filling up content, posting articles. But I still haven't created the sites myself.

A year ago, I decided to try to learn how to create websites on my own. I watched video tutorials on YouTube until I found out about the existence of the RS-School.

In the summer, I went to Stage 0 and finished it. On Stage 0, we created a large Shelter project (photo Shelter), with a drop-down menu, slider, pop-up windows and pagination. It was very interesting experience. We also made an audio player, a random game, and I made a "pairs" game.

I'm finishing Stage 1 now. On Stage 1, we made a website about New Year's gifts (photo Christmas Shop), it was very exciting. We made two games: Simon Says and Nonograms. I really like to create pages according to the Design in Figma. It gives me great pleasure. Also, I really like that you can immediately see the result of your work. I like to see your website come to life and interact with the user.

During my studies at RS-School, I acquired many useful skills and learned a lot. Comparing myself before taking the courses and at the moment, I understand that there has been a lot of growth. But I still have a lot to learn and a lot to study.

Of course, it's hard to study, especially to find the time for it, but there is a great desire to create websites. I really like to create pages, but JavaScript is still needs a lot of learning for me. But I believe that I will succeed, I will learn how to write logical and beautiful code and become an excellent specialist.

I am married, and have two beautiful children and two crazy dogs. I want to show my children on my own example that if you study a lot, you will achieve everything.
